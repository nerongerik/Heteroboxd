# Heteroboxd

Heteroboxd is an open-source, free-speech social film discovery app for cinephile reactionaries, political extremists, and religious fundamentalists (normal movie-goers from 30 years ago).

## Features
- Track films you've seen or add new ones to your watchlist  
- Review films and rate them on a 5-star scale
- Create your own custom (rank)lists
- Read, like, and comment on other cinephiles' reviews
- Follow your favorite cinephiles to stay up-to-date with their binging
- Explore the work of your favorite actors and directors, or filter movies by release date, average rating, etc.

## Stack
Heteroboxd is projected to employ React Native for cross-platform frontend development (Web, Android, iOS), C# (ASP.NET) for backend development, and PostgreSQL for databasing [*all heavily supported by tMDB's API, of course*]

## Contributing

Heteroboxd is a **solo** project, and external contributions (pull requests) are not accepted.
The repository is public for transparency and learning purposes only.

## Installation

Running Heteroboxd locally is **heavily** disadvised at the moment, as a usable build hasn't yet been achieved. Await the creation of the first stable build.
